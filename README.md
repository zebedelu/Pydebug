# Pydebug
A Python compiler that pauses when it gives an error, so you can see the error message directly in the terminal.

I created this code with the aim of speeding up the detection of errors in the codes.
On lower-end computers, VS Code often feels slow and laggy when running programs in its built-in terminal.
This script was created to fix that issue — instead of using VS Code’s terminal, it runs directly in the default Windows terminal, making things faster and much more convenient.

that version is only for Windows!
